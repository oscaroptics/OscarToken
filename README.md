# OscarToken

This is a solidity project that made a ERC20 Token named OscarToken which is deployed on remixIDE.
## Description

This program is a smart contract written in Solidity. The is an ERC20 Token contract

I've created the contract and deployed it on remixIDE after compiling it. After deploying I have called the contract address on the online RemixIDE after connecting to the remixIDE addresses on RemixIDE. The contract functions appear on the RemixIDE and I can interact with the contract on the IDE.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

open remixIDE and paste this code at there and then we will be good to go to make our own token.

- Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/
- Go to the 'DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS' Tab and below in the At Address input box enter the contract address that you get after compiling and deplyoing the smart contract
- The functions will appear and we can interact with it.
